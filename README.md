# MCU-Drivers
This repository contains drivers for two popular microcontrollers: Atmega32 and STM32F103x6. The purpose of these drivers is to provide easy-to-use, efficient, and reliable interfaces for interacting with these microcontrollers, enabling developers to focus on their application logic rather than dealing with low-level hardware complexities.  
  
## Supported Microcontrollers
- Atmega32: Atmega32 is an 8-bit microcontroller from the AVR family, developed by Microchip Technology. It is widely used in various embedded systems and DIY projects due to its versatility and rich peripheral set.  
  
- STM32F103x6: STM32F103x6 is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller from STMicroelectronics. It offers a balance of performance and power efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to consumer electronics.

## Features
The drivers in this repository encompass a variety of essential functionalities for both microcontrollers, including but not limited to:

- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) management for controlling digital pins.
- RCC (Reset and control) for providing the clock for all peripherals
- External Interrupts for responding to external events and triggers.
- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication for serial data exchange.
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication for interfacing with external devices, such as sensors and displays.
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication for connecting multiple peripherals using a two-wire interface.
- Timers and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for precise timing and generating analog-like signals.
- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) for reading analog sensor values.
